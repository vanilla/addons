 * Bluehost has very specific email requirements.
 * It blocks most outgoing ports so an external smtp server won't work.
 * It requires a specific email header or else php's mail() function won't work.
 * Check the following discussion for the solution implemented here: http://forum.joomla.org/viewtopic.php?p=246445
 *
 * This plugin modifies the core PhpMailer file and will get used instead of it when the plugin is enabled.
