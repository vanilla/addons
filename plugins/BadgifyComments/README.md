### Badgification

This plugin allows admins to add a preformatted badge to a discussion that is awarded to anyone who comments on a discussion. There will be one badge per discussion.

## Basic Features

 - Settings page in dashboard to set the default values of the badges that will be created for discussions (Name, Points, Class)
 - Link in the flyout menu which would display based on permission to create a badge for a discussion
 - Badges awarded automatically on submission of the comment form

 ##Possible Features

 - Upload an image feauture as a default badge
 - Hide this class of badge on the user's profile page since he/she might have many of them.

## Possible Problems

Since admins and/or mods will be adding these badges to many discussions there could be scaling implications. If we have 1000s of badges the badges page in the dashboard could get very heavy.
